wheelbase_gazebo is an user defined package in ROS. <br>
Currently the scripts in it are made such that, given as a input(on terminal) the required linear and angular velocities, the script prints out the rpm of each motor individually on the terminal. <br>
To run the scripts, launch the launch file using - $ roslaunch wheelbase_gazebo cmd_vel_topic.launch <br>
<br>
TODO - fine tune the inputting and printing speed/rate.
