wheelbase_gazebo is an user defined package in ROS.
Currently the scripts in it are made such that, given as a input(on terminal) the required linear and angular velocities, the script prints out the rpm of each motor individually on the terminal.
To run the scripts, launch the launch file using - $ roslaunch wheelbase_gazebo cmd_vel_topic.launch
